# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Developer and am currently working on both personal projects and a project for a game studio called Wee Tattie. I have a BSc in Computing and IT (Software) where I have even more skill than what's shown on my github.
From mobile applications, OOP to AI using Python, I have a lot of skills to show off. I have always wanted to code since I was 11 but my current aim is to create websites that are responsive and unique by experimenting and learning how others do it.

##Skills ðŸ“Œ
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Python
- Java
- Node.js
- Typescript
- React.js
- Next.js
- Machine learning

##Currently Working On
My portfolio website, which is public on my profile, and multiple other side projects!
